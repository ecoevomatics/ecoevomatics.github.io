# EcoEvoMatics lab website

Welcome to the source code for the EcoEvoMatics lab website at UMaine. This website is based off the site of [Laurent HÃ©bert-Dufresne](http://laurenthebertdufresne.github.io/), with additional resources from the [Keedy Lab website](https://github.com/keedylab/keedylab.github.io).  Many thanks to all those folks for their code and making it open!
