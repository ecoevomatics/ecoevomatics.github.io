  Andy is Assistant Professor of Ecological Bioinformatics at the University of 
  Maine in the School of Biology and Ecology, and the Maine Center for Genetics 
  in the Environment. His work focuses on discovering general processes that 
  drive the origin and maintenance of biodiversity using ecological and 
  evolutionary theory in concert with novel data streams from large-scale 
  inventories of the diversity of life. These inventories are increasingly 
  enabled by next-generation sequencing methods such as eDNA and metabarcoding. 
  Much of this work has been based in Hawai`i, with recent expansion into arid 
  and costal ecosystems. Andy is committed to diversity and equity in science, 
  open and reproducible research, and the success of his students and 
  colleagues. Before joining the University of Maine, Andy was a postdoc at the 
  Santa Fe Institute, and before that he completed his PhD at the University of 
  California, Berkeley.

  description: '
  Beth is a PhD student in Ecology and Environmental Sciences through the School 
  of Biology and Ecology at the University of Maine. She earned her Bachelors of 
  Science in Biology at Oregon State University with a focus in Marine Biology, 
  and studied adaptive and evolutionary genomics, community ecology, and thermal 
  stress responses in regards to intertidal invertebrate and algal species. At 
  the University of Maine, Beth is focused on working with eDNA as an aquatic 
  monitoring tool and joining efforts to understand the continuing impacts of 
  dams on Maine fisheries and river ecology. Beth is committed to equity and 
  improving communication between scientists and non-scientists, and hopes to 
  work with local and indigenous communities in Maine. Other projects she is 
  interested include biological impacts of microplastics, subtidal ecology, and 
  improving data accessibility and metadata records in STEM fields.

  Heather is a PhD student in the EcoEvoMatics Lab. She has worked all over the 
  country as a naturalist and educator, but is never more at home than when on 
  Maine's rocky coastline. She got her MS at San Francisco State University 
  working with biofilms on microplastics as a student in the lab of Dr. Ed 
  Carpenter. More recently, she has coordinated environmental monitoring 
  research at an environmental research non-profit organization in Blue Hill, 
  ME. She brings with her a passion for understanding coastal processes and a 
  strong desire to sustain natural resources and increase climate change 
  resiliency in the state of Maine.

  Isaac is majoring in Computer Science and is interested in video game 
  development and data analysis in reference to machine learning.  He is 
  actively working on the development of the DNA barcoding reference database 
  for Maine's marine and aquatic species.  He is Co-President of the GDG Club

  description: "
  Isaac's core research involves characterizing and developing models to explain 
  the distribution of genetic variation in ecological communities. A related 
  focus is to develop models of how biodiversity accumulates in ecological 
  communities that integrate over multiple levels of biological organization, 
  including species abundances, genetic diversities, and phylogenetic 
  relationships. Before coming to Maine, Isaac obtained his PhD from the 
  Graduate Center of the City University of New York under the supervision of 
  Mike Hickerson. He then spent two years as a postdoc with Helene Morlon at 
  Institut de Biologie de lâ€™Ecole Normale Superieure in Paris, where he 
  developed theory and models of island biodiversity genomics. Isaac is a firm 
  believer in Bigfoot.
