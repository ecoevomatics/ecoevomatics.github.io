  Andy Rominger is Assistant Professor of Ecological Bioinformatics at the University of Maine in the School of 
  Biology and Ecology, and the Maine Center for Genetics in the Environment. His work focuses on discovering general
  processes that drive the origin and maintenance of biodiversity using ecological and evolutionary theory in concert
  with novel data streams from large-scale inventories of the diversity of life. These inventories are increasingly 
  enabled by next-generation sequencing methods such as eDNA and metabarcoding. Much of this work has been based in 
  Hawai`i, with recent expansion into arid and costal ecosystems. Andy is committed to diversity and 
  equity in science, open and reproducible research, and the success of his students and colleagues. Before joining 
  the University of Maine, Andy was a postdoc at the Santa Fe Institute, and before that he completed his PhD at the 
  University of California, Berkeley.
