  Andy is Assistant Professor in the School of Life Sciences at UH Mānoa. 
  His work focuses on developing computational tools to support Indigenous Data 
  Sovereignty and the ethical study of biodiversity. He is fascinated by the ways 
  different knowledge systems conveive of nature and biodiversity, as well as how 
  large-scale patterns seem to consistently emerge across disparate scales of life
  from SNP frequencies to microbial communities to adaptive radiations of arthropods
  in Hawaiʻi. 
  Andy is committed to diversity, equity, inclusion, and justice in science. 
  Please see more on that in our lab's research, teaching, and philosophy.

  description: '
  Beth is a masters student in Ecology and Environmental Sciences through the School 
  of Biology and Ecology at the University of Maine. She earned her Bachelors of 
  Science in Biology at Oregon State University with a focus in Marine Biology, 
  and studied adaptive and evolutionary genomics, community ecology, and thermal 
  stress responses in regards to intertidal invertebrate and algal species. At 
  the University of Maine, Beth is focused on working with eDNA as an aquatic 
  monitoring tool and joining efforts to understand the continuing impacts of 
  dams on Maine fisheries and river ecology. Beth is committed to equity and 
  improving communication between scientists and non-scientists, and hopes to 
  work with local and indigenous communities in Maine. Other projects she is 
  interested include biological impacts of microplastics, subtidal ecology, and 
  improving data accessibility and metadata records in STEM fields.

  description: "I am researching eDNA of marine 
  invertebrates within the Gulf of Maine to devise plans to mitigate overfishing 
  within Maine's commercial fisheries and to relay the health of the coastal 
  ecosystem of Maine; while also establishing establishing detection rates to 
  ascertain species-specific correlations between fish biomass and eDNA read 
  output. I was also previously employed by NOAA as an environmental scientist 
  and groundfish observer to collect population and genetic data on sea mammals, 
  sea birds, and invertebrates.

  Heather is a PhD student in the EcoEvoMatics Lab. She has worked all over the 
  country as a naturalist and educator, but is never more at home than when on 
  Maine's rocky coastline. She got her MS at San Francisco State University 
  working with biofilms on microplastics as a student in the lab of Dr. Ed 
  Carpenter. More recently, she has coordinated environmental monitoring 
  research at an environmental research non-profit organization in Blue Hill, 
  ME. She brings with her a passion for understanding coastal processes and a 
  strong desire to sustain natural resources and increase climate change 
  resiliency in the state of Maine.

#   Isaac's core research involves characterizing and developing models to explain 
#   the distribution of genetic variation in ecological communities. A related 
#   focus is to develop models of how biodiversity accumulates in ecological 
#   communities that integrate over multiple levels of biological organization, 
#   including species abundances, genetic diversities, and phylogenetic 
#   relationships. Before coming to Maine, Isaac obtained his PhD from the 
#   Graduate Center of the City University of New York under the supervision of 
#   Mike Hickerson. He then spent two years as a postdoc with Helene Morlon at 
#   Institut de Biologie de l’Ecole Normale Superieure in Paris, where he 
#   developed theory and models of island biodiversity genomics. Isaac is a firm 
#   believer in Bigfoot.
