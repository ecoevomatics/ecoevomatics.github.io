                <p>A lot has happened in the Keedy Lab in the last few months‚Ä¶</p>

<p>First of all, I‚Äôm excited to report that the lab has been awarded an NIH MIRA (R35) grant, which will provide funding for 5 years!  With this support from the NIH, we can continue our work to develop new methods in multistate X-ray crystallography and elucidate allosteric mechanisms in phosphatases.</p>

<p>Relatedly, we are hiring for multiple positions in the lab.  Email Dr. Keedy and apply by clicking <a href="https://cuny.jobs/new-york-ny/research-associate-structural-biology-initiative/3F61F1DE234B4BF7BA9E5777089B982C/job/">this link</a> if you are interested in a postdoc position.</p>

<p>Finally, two excellent undergraduates have finished their summer research in the lab: Kristiana ‚ÄúSpring‚Äù Smith with the B^3 REU Program (from my alma mater Rhodes College!) and Minyoung ‚ÄúLily‚Äù Kim with the CSURP Program, both of whom worked with Maryam Azeem as a mentor here.  We wish them both the best as they return to college for the fall, and beyond!</p>

                <p>Hello, world! This is the first post from the Keedy Lab.  Only 1+ year late!</p>

<p>We‚Äôve gotten off to an amazing start in that time.  See below for a photo of the lab during the 2018 holiday season.</p>

<p>Looking forward to what the rest of 2019 and beyond have to bring!  Watch this space‚Ä¶</p>
