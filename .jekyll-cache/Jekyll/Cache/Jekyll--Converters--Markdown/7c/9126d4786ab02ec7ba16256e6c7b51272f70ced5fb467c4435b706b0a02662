While working under Dr. Frey’s supervision, Maryam developed her research interests in structural biology and X-ray crystallography. She used computational and structure-based methods for creating docking models, predicting mutations in the HIV Reverse Transcriptase enzyme, and analyzing protein-ligand interactions. In 2018, Maryam joined the Keedy Lab, where she is spearheading efforts to characterize the “invisible” conformations of tyrosine phosphatase enzymes and reveal how they contribute to allosteric regulation.</p>
