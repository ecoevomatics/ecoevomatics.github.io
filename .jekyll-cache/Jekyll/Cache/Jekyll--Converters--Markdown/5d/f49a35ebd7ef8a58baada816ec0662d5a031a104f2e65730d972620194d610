I"h<p>Ali is a BSc (Hons) Biology and MPhil Biochemistry graduate of the University of Portsmouth, UK. His MPhil focused on the characterisation of cellulases involved in the production of second-generation biofuels, igniting an interest into the field of X-ray crystallography. He earned his PhD from the University of Essex, UK, in early 2020, under the co-supervision of <a href="https://www.essex.ac.uk/people/hough20300/mike-hough">Dr. Mike Hough</a> from the University of Essex and <a href="https://www.diamond.ac.uk/Instruments/Mx/I24/Staff/Owen.html">Dr. Robin Owen</a> from Diamond Light Source, UK. His research focused on the development of serial crystallography data collection and processing methods for both synchrotrons and X-ray free-electron lasers, used to analyse and exploit the effects of radiation damage in metalloproteins. Ali joined the Keedy lab as a postdoc in the spring of 2020. He aims to bring his experience in crystallographic multi-dataset processing and analysis to the ASRC, in order to further unlock understanding within the field of phosphatase ligand binding, activity, and allostery.</p>
