I"<p>Blake joined the Keedy lab as a postdoc in November 2019. He earned his PhD from <a href="https://www.monash.edu/">Monash University</a>, Australia, where he worked with <a href="https://www.facebook.com/BuckleLab/">A/Prof. Ashley Buckle</a> on the protein engineering &amp; design of a small, potent, peptidic protease inhibitor from sunflower seeds.</p>

<p>As part of his doctoral research, he began to explore allosteric inhibition of proteases; he is now exploring allosteric inhibition of phosphatases.</p>

<p>Blakeâ€™s research aims to untangle the allosteric wiring within enzymes using a hybrid experimental and computational approach. He is currently developing methods in X-ray crystallography to model multiple conformations into multi-crystal datasets.</p>
