<p>If you’re currently finishing or have recently finished your PhD, and are interested in a postdoctoral position in the lab, please email Dr. Keedy and include your CV.</p>

<h3 id="phd-students">PhD Students</h3>

<p>If you’re interested in PhD thesis research in the Keedy Lab, you must first apply to one of the following PhD programs through the <a href="https://www.gc.cuny.edu/Home">CUNY Graduate Center</a>:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.gc.cuny.edu/Page-Elements/Academics-Research-Centers-Initiatives/Doctoral-Programs/Biochemistry/Admissions">CUNY PhD Program in Biochemistry</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.gc.cuny.edu/Page-Elements/Academics-Research-Centers-Initiatives/Doctoral-Programs/Chemistry/Prospective-Students">CUNY PhD Program in Chemistry</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Once you’re admitted, you’ll have the opportunity to visit the Keedy Lab at the ASRC during interviews, to do a research rotation after you enroll, and to potentially join the lab if there is a good fit.  That said, feel free to email Dr. Keedy before or during the application process to discuss research project ideas!</p>

<h3 id="undergraduates">Undergraduates</h3>

<p>If you are a talented undergraduate interested in doing research in the lab, email Dr. Keedy with your grades in relevant courses (Biochemistry, Cell and Molecular Biology, Computer Science, etc.).  I am more likely to accept students who can make a significant time commitment in terms of hours per week in the lab and number of semesters.</p>
