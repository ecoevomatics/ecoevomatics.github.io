I""<p>Daniel Keedy has been an Assistant Professor with the <a href="http://structbio.asrc.cuny.edu">Structural Biology Initiative</a> at the <a href="http://asrc.cuny.edu">CUNY Advanced Science Research Center (ASRC)</a> and the <a href="https://www.ccny.cuny.edu/Chemistry">Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry</a> at <a href="https://www.ccny.cuny.edu/">The City College of New York</a> since January 2018. He is also affiliated with the PhD Programs in <a href="https://www.gc.cuny.edu/Page-Elements/Academics-Research-Centers-Initiatives/Doctoral-Programs/Biochemistry">Biochemistry</a> and <a href="https://www.gc.cuny.edu/Page-Elements/Academics-Research-Centers-Initiatives/Doctoral-Programs/Chemistry">Chemistry</a> at the <a href="https://www.gc.cuny.edu/home">CUNY Graduate Center</a>.</p>

<p>Prior to his appointment, Daniel was an AP Giannini Postdoctoral Fellow in Bioengineering and Therapeutic Sciences at the University of California, San Francisco working with <a href="https://fraserlab.com">James Fraser</a>. He earned his PhD in Biochemistry and Structural Biology &amp; Biophysics from Duke University with <a href="http://kinemage.biochem.duke.edu">Jane and David Richardson</a>, after receiving his BA in Biochemistry &amp; Molecular Biology from Rhodes College.</p>

<p>As principal investigator of the Keedy Lab, Daniel develops experimental and computational methods to control proteins by biasing toward specific conformations that underlie functions such as allostery, ligand binding, and catalysis. His work reveals new opportunities to modulate the activities of therapeutic targets such as protein tyrosine phosphatases with small molecules and protein engineering, and also offers insights into more general evolutionary processes that led to functional diversity in the human proteome.</p>
