We are excited to welcome undergrads, grad students, and postdocs into the lab! 

If you are interested in working with us, please reach out to [Andy](mailto:rominger@hawaii.edu) with a brief description of your 
research interests and what you hope to get out of working with our group.  


# Undergraduate

We are excited to work with undergraduate researchers. We welcome undergraduate
honors projects in our lab and encourage students to work with us to pursue 
funding for their research.  


# Graduate

We are currently not actively seeking graduate students, but please still get
in touch if you might like to join the lab!

We are  excited to work with prospective postdocs to write new fellowship and 
grant proposals. Of particular relevance are the NSF Postdoctoral Fellowships
