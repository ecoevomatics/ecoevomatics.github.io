We are excited to welcome undergrads, grad students, and postdocs into the lab! *We currently have fully-funded PhD and postdoc positions available!  See below for more information!*

If you are interested in working with us, please reach out to [Andy](mailto:andrew.rominger@maine.edu) with a brief description of your research interests and what you hope to get out of working with our group.  Below are specific opportunities to join our lab.

# Undergraduate

We are excited to work with undergraduate researchers. We welcome undergraduate honors projects in our lab and encourage students to work with us to pursue funding for their research.  Please consult the [UMaine Center for Undergraduate Research](https://cugr.umaine.edu/).


# Graduate

**We are currently offering a PhD position in our lab with full funding for 4 years of stipend, tuition, and health insurance coverage.** This position is part of the [Maine-eDNA program](https://umaine.edu/edna/) and the successful applicant will join a thriving research community aimed at understanding the biodiversity of Maine's coastal ecosystems and promoting their sustainability. Please [click here](https://www.ecoevomatics.org/2020/10/20/phd_ad.html) to read the position advertisement for more details. 

Regardless of existing funding, we also encourage all graduate students to pursue external fellowship support as part of their professional development. Please get in touch if you are interested in co-developing a graduate fellowship proposal to join our group!  Of particular relevance is the [NSF Graduate Research Fellowship](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/).


# Postdoc

**We are currently offering a fully-funded, 2-year postdoc position as part of our [Rules of Life Engine](https://role-model.github.io/) NSF grant.** The postdoc will be responsible for contributing to the development of a novel modeling framework to jointly predict multiple dimensions of biodiversity, from genes to communities, and have support to develop their own research projects in alignment with the themes of the Rules of Life Engine grant.  Please check back soon for the full position advertisement with more details!

We are also excited to work with prospective postdocs to write new fellowship and grant proposals. Of particular relevance are the NSF Postdoctoral Fellowships (in [Biology](https://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=503622&org=NSF), [Earth Sciences](https://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=503144&org=NSF), or [Mathematics](https://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=5301&org=NSF)) and the [James S. McDonnell Postdoctoral Fellowship](https://www.jsmf.org/apply/fellowship/).
