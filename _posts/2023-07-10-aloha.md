We're a strong mixture of happy and sad to announce that We're moving our lab to the University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa.  Aloha e ʻohana hou o Mānoa!  A hui hou to everyone in Maine!

We're excited to be able to pursue our work of supporting Indigenous governance of research and studying biodiversity in the Hawaiian context.

That's it for now, but we'll be updating more soon!
