*Update (1 September 2021): this position has been filled*

We seek an enthusiastic researcher to join the EcoEvoMatics lab (principal investigator Dr. Andy Rominger) at the University of Maine as a postdoc.

We are seeking applicants with strong quantitative and computational backgrounds, as well as experience in next-generation sequencing-enabled approaches to studying biodiversity. The postdoc is expected to contribute to the [Rules of Life Engine](https://role-model.github.io/){:target="_blank"} (RoLE) project, specifically expanding the functionality of the RoLE model and testing it across a diversity of datasets. These data come from close collaborators of the project and include impressive quantifications of the biodiversity in systems such as [Hawaiian terrestrial arthropods](https://nature.berkeley.edu/hawaiidimensions/){:target="_blank"}, marine invertebrates in [Palau](http://mnd.ucmerced.edu/Research/Overview.html){:target="_blank"}, birds and arthropods in the [Brazillian Atlantic Forest](https://www.carnavallab.org/biodiversity-prediction){:target="_blank"}, and the entirety of publicly available data provided by the [National Ecological Observatory Network](https://www.neonscience.org/){:target="_blank"}.

#### Qualifications:

- Conferral of a PhD degree before 1 September 2021
- Experience with scientific computing, ideally including strength in Python, R, Bash, C++
- Experience with design of UX/UI for scientific software
- Experience in developing open software as part of a team (e.g. familiarity with Git and an online Git repository such as GitHub)
- Familiarity with next generation sequencing approaches for the study of biodiversity (e.g. metabarcoding)


The EcoEvoMatics lab is jointly housed in the [School of Biology and Ecology](https://sbe.umaine.edu){:target="_blank"} and the [Maine Center for Genetics in the Environment](https://umaine.edu/mcge){:target="_blank"}. The postdoc will also join a vibrant community of researchers working together as part of [Maine-eDNA](https://umaine.edu/edna/){:target="_blank"} and a network of collaborators contributing to the Rules of Life Engine project.

In the EcoEvoMatics lab we value diversity and strive to be a safe and welcoming space for all researchers. Please read more about our [lab philosophy](https://www.ecoevomatics.org/philosophy){:target="_blank"} on our group website.

The anticipated salary for this position is $50,000 commensurate with experience and qualifications.  Ideal start date is 1 September 2021 with some room for flexibility.

To apply please submit materials through the official job posting: [https://umaine.hiretouch.com/job-details?jobid=66549](https://umaine.hiretouch.com/job-details?jobid=66549){:target="_blank"}. Required materials are:

- a cover letter discussing your interest in joining the EcoEvoMatics lab and the Rule of Life Engine project; this letter is a space to discuss your research interests, desired outcomes of a postdoc in our group, and your engagement with diversity, equity, and inclusion
- a resume/curriculum vitae
- contact information for three professional references
